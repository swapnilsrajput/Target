## Q7. Actionable Insights
- Trend for online purchases is increasing.
- Need to improve time to delivery for top 5 states 
- Cost of order is increasing year on year basis. One of the reasons seems to be increasing Freight value.
- Time to delivery is affecting customer experience as there is a lot of unpredictability on the delivery date. There is too much gap in estimated delivery and actual time to deliver.
- Delay in time to delivery affects the future business and acts as a hindrance for future purchases.

## Q8. Recommendations
There is a growing trend on e-commerce in Brazil year on year basis which is reflected through a number of parameters such as total number of unique orders, total sales and total order price as the years are passing by. By increasing the product offering, more customers can be attracted and overall business can be grown.
Time to delivery needs to be improved and estimated delivery needs to be calculated correctly to avoid unnecessary confusion for the customers. Delayed time to delivery increases dissatisfaction, hence it needs to be fixed. 

Average Freight value per order is on a higher side, it certainly needs to be reevaluated in order to attract more customers.
